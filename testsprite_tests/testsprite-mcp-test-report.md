## Test Execution Status

⚠️ **Note**: Automated test execution could not be completed due to TestSprite authentication requirements. The test plan has been prepared for manual execution or future automated testing once authentication is configured.

## Recommendations

1. **Authentication Configuration**: Configure TestSprite API credentials for automated testing
2. **Test Data Setup**: Create dedicated test accounts for each user role
3. **Environment Isolation**: Set up a dedicated test environment to avoid production data interference
4. **Continuous Testing**: Implement CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution
5. **Performance Testing**: Add load testing for high-traffic scenarios (booking portal)
6. **Accessibility Testing**: Include WCAG compliance tests for public-facing interfaces

## Critical User Flows to Prioritize

1. **Complete Booking Flow**: Client portal → Service selection → Time slot → Confirmation
2. **Staff Daily Workflow**: Login → View appointments → Update availability → Client check-in
3. **Admin Operations**: Dashboard → Reports → Staff management → Settings configuration
4. **Inventory Management**: Low stock alert → Purchase order → Stock update
5. **Payment Processing**: Booking → Payment → Invoice generation

## Known Issues from Documentation

Based on CLAUDE.md, the following issues should be considered during testing:
- Help page returns 404 (route not implemented)
- Email service requires API key configuration
- Some placeholder content may remain
- Edge function deployments require shell scripts

## Next Steps

1. Configure TestSprite authentication credentials
2. Execute the prepared test plan
3. Document any discovered issues
4. Create regression test suite for critical paths
5. Implement visual regression testing for UI consistency

## Conclusion

The SalonSphere platform demonstrates comprehensive functionality across multiple user roles and business operations. The prepared test plan covers all critical features and user journeys. Once authentication is configured, automated testing can provide continuous validation of the application's functionality and reliability.
