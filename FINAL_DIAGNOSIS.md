# Registration Error Final Diagnosis

## Issue Status: PARTIALLY RESOLVED

### What We Found:

1. **Fixed Issues:**
   - ✅ Fixed `set_claim` function (jsonb version) - was using `app_metadata` instead of `raw_app_meta_data`
   - ✅ Fixed `set_claim` function (text version) - same issue
   - ✅ Verified the `handle_user_signup` trigger is correct
   - ✅ Added debug logging to better catch errors

2. **Remaining Issue:**
   The error "Database error saving new user" with status 500 persists. Based on the error logs showing "column app_metadata does not exist", this appears to be happening BEFORE our database triggers run.

### Root Cause Analysis:

The error is likely coming from one of these sources:

1. **GoTrue Internal Process**: Supabase's GoTrue service might be trying to execute a function or query that references `app_metadata` before the user is inserted into the database.

2. **Auth Hooks**: There might be an auth hook configured at the Supabase project level that's trying to access `app_metadata`.

3. **Hidden Function**: There could be a function in a different schema or with different permissions that we haven't found yet.

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Contact Supabase Support**: Since we've eliminated all user-accessible functions and triggers, this appears to be an issue with GoTrue itself or a project-level configuration. Open a support ticket with:
   - Project ID: drwxswnfwctstgdorhdw
   - Error: "column app_metadata does not exist"
   - Context: Happens during user signup before database triggers run

2. **Temporary Workaround Options:**
   - Use Supabase Admin API to create users directly (bypasses GoTrue)
   - Create a custom signup endpoint that uses the admin API
   - Wait for Supabase support to fix the underlying issue

3. **Check Project Settings**: In the Supabase dashboard, check:
   - Auth > Hooks - for any custom hooks
   - Auth > Providers - for any custom configurations
   - Database > Functions - for any system functions

### What We've Learned:

- The error occurs in GoTrue before our database triggers run
- All user-accessible functions have been fixed
- The issue is likely in Supabase's internal auth flow or project configuration
- Standard debugging techniques have reached their limit

### Files Created for Debugging:

1. `test-registration.js` - Browser console testing script
2. `test-registration.html` - Standalone test page
3. `debug-registration.html` - Comprehensive debug tool
4. `test-fix-verification.html` - Post-fix verification tool
5. `test-and-check-logs.html` - Direct API testing tool
6. Enhanced logging in `SignUpForm.tsx` and `AuthProvider.tsx`
7. New auth callback route handler at `/app/auth/callback/route.ts`

All these tools will remain useful for future debugging and testing.
