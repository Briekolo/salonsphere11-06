# Registration Error Final Diagnosis

## Issue Status: ✅ RESOLVED

### What We Found:

1. **Fixed Issues:**
   - ✅ Fixed `set_claim` function (jsonb version) - was using `app_metadata` instead of `raw_app_meta_data`
   - ✅ Fixed `set_claim` function (text version) - same issue
   - ✅ Verified the `handle_user_signup` trigger is correct
   - ✅ Added debug logging to better catch errors

2. **Resolution:**
   The registration now works successfully! The fixes to the `set_claim` functions resolved the issue completely.

### Root Cause Analysis:

The issue was caused by two `set_claim` functions in the database that were referencing a non-existent column `app_metadata`. In Supabase, the correct column name is `raw_app_meta_data`.

The functions were being called during the user registration process, likely by the `sync_tenant_id_claim` trigger on the `public.users` table.

### Solution Applied:

1. **Fixed both versions of set_claim function**:
   - `set_claim(uuid, text, jsonb)` - Fixed to use `raw_app_meta_data`
   - `set_claim(uuid, text, text)` - Fixed to use `raw_app_meta_data`

2. **Applied migrations**:
   - `fix_set_claim_function_app_metadata_column`
   - `fix_set_claim_text_overload`

These fixes resolved the issue completely, and users can now register successfully!

### What We've Learned:

- Always check for column name mismatches in database functions
- Supabase uses `raw_app_meta_data` and `raw_user_meta_data`, not `app_metadata`
- Multiple overloaded functions may exist - check all versions
- The `set_claim` functions were the root cause of the registration failure

### Files Created for Debugging:

1. `test-registration.js` - Browser console testing script
2. `test-registration.html` - Standalone test page
3. `debug-registration.html` - Comprehensive debug tool
4. `test-fix-verification.html` - Post-fix verification tool
5. `test-and-check-logs.html` - Direct API testing tool
6. Enhanced logging in `SignUpForm.tsx` and `AuthProvider.tsx`
7. New auth callback route handler at `/app/auth/callback/route.ts`

All these tools will remain useful for future debugging and testing.
